# Shared helpers for every Salt (saltapp.ai) Langflow component in this
# package: building a client, resolving an agent's own identity, the
# send helper (Salt Send Message, plain or encrypted depending on the
# room), the open-room read helper (Salt Read Room), the card-poll
# helpers behind Salt Ask Human (`get_card`, `card_id_from_post`), and the
# single-shot outbox-check helper behind Salt Read Updates
# (`check_for_event`).
#
# Deliberately thin: every real Salt call goes straight through
# `saltapp.client.SaltClient` with plain strings pulled from a component's
# field values -- no `saltapp.identity.Identity` object, no
# `saltapp.integrations.*` (that layer is built for a persistent
# framework-agent process; a Langflow component runs once per flow
# invocation, so it does not fit). See AGENTS.md for the full rationale.
#
# NO POLLING, anywhere in this module (2026-09-22 rewrite -- the owner's
# explicit rule, via the task coordinator): a Langflow component's build
# method is a single stateless call with no persistent process behind it,
# so it must never loop or sleep waiting for something to happen. The old
# `poll_for_event` (a `while True: ... time.sleep(...)` short-poll loop)
# is gone; `check_for_event` below makes exactly ONE
# `GET /api/v1/agent/updates` call per invocation and returns immediately
# with whatever it finds. Genuine push still needs a persistent process
# outside this package -- see README.md's "Push vs. on-demand" section.
#
# ONE MORE THING removed 2026-09-26: `check_for_event`/the shared outbox
# used to be how Salt Ask Human checked for its own card's tap too. It no
# longer is -- see `get_card`'s docstring below and HANDOFF.md's
# 2026-09-26 entry. `check_for_event` (and the outbox it reads) is now
# used ONLY by Salt Read Updates; Salt Ask Human reads its own card
# directly and never touches `GET /api/v1/agent/updates` at all.
