# Salt Read Updates (was Salt Trigger/Listen): read this agent's Salt
# updates for whatever is new since the last check, in exactly ONE call,
# instead of Langflow's built-in Webhook component. See AGENTS.md and
# README.md for why not the built-in Webhook (short version: Webhook
# exposes only the request BODY, never headers, and Salt's signature
# lives in a header; an unverified card_interaction/invoice_paid/
# chat_opened payload is plaintext and actionable, so it must never be
# trusted unverified).
#
# On demand, not poll-and-wait: this component's build method runs once
# per flow invocation and returns immediately with whatever one
# GET /api/v1/agent/updates call finds -- no loop, no sleep, no wait
# budget. It is meant to sit at the start of a flow that is itself
# triggered on its own schedule/cron/manual run and pick up whatever is
# new since last time. Genuine push needs a persistent process outside
# this package; see README.md's "Push vs. on-demand" section.
#
# ONE POLLER PER AGENT, still, even after 2026-09-26: this is now the
# ONLY component in this package that reads GET /api/v1/agent/updates
# (Salt Ask Human moved to reading its own card directly and no longer
# shares this cursor -- see _salt_common.get_card's docstring and
# HANDOFF.md's 2026-09-26 entry). salt-api keeps exactly ONE
# `agent_updates_acked_id` per agent, not one per caller, so running two
# concurrent checks against the SAME agent_id (two Read Updates calls, or
# one beside a socket-mode Agent/any other consumer of that agent's
# outbox) can still resolve rows out from under one another. Never wire
# this component into Salt Ask Human's check -- Ask Human must keep
# reading its own card, never this outbox.
