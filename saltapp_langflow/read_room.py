# Salt Read Room: on-demand read of a chat's session + messages, with an
# optional `last` cursor for a catch-up window (saltapp 0.2.0's
# `GET /api/v1/chats/:id?last=`, wrapped by _salt_common.read_room). Every
# returned message already carries `encrypted`/`delivered_because`
# verbatim from salt-api -- this component passes them through as-is,
# never recomputes them.
#
# Works fully keyless: `api_key` is optional (blank sends no api-key
# header at all), which reads a public, unencrypted ("open") room with no
# identity whatsoever -- see SaltClient.get_chat's own docstring. Anything
# else with a blank key still 404s, indistinguishably from "not found".
#
# This is the on-demand "read new since cursor" half of the push/pull
# pairing described in README.md's "Push vs. on-demand" section -- it
# never blocks waiting for a new message; call it again with `last` set
# to the newest `seq` you have already seen. Genuine push into a running
# flow needs a persistent process outside this package; see that section.
#
# No private_key/passphrase fields: unlike the other components in this
# package, which keep those two fields present-but-unused for a
# consistent field layout (see AGENTS.md, "The keyless boundary"), this
# component returns the room's raw messages as-is -- ciphertext included,
# for an encrypted room -- and structurally never decrypts anything, so
# there is no future path where it would start using them either.
