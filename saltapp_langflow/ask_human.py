# Salt Ask Human: post a card with button options into a Salt chat, then
# check ONCE for a tap and always return -- either the answer, or a
# pending result carrying the card's id so a LATER flow run (this same
# component, re-invoked with `card_id` set) can check again. There is no
# waiting here: a Langflow component's build method is a single stateless
# call with no persistent process behind it, and per the owner's explicit
# rule this package must never loop or sleep waiting for something to
# happen. See AGENTS.md ("The ask/check design") for the full write-up,
# and README.md's "Push vs. on-demand" section for what changes if you
# need a genuine wait-then-answer instead of this check-yourself shape.
#
# Reads the TAPPED CARD's own interaction log (salt-api 0.96.0,
# `GET /api/v1/cards/:id`, via `_salt_common.get_card`) -- NEVER the
# shared socket-mode outbox (`GET /api/v1/agent/updates`). See
# `_salt_common.get_card`'s docstring and HANDOFF.md's 2026-09-26 entry
# for the full story: that outbox keeps exactly ONE forward-only cursor
# PER AGENT, so two concurrent asks against the same agent (or one ask
# beside a Salt Read Updates check, or beside any other listener draining
# that agent's outbox) could silently consume each other's answers, and
# any `after` one of them sent permanently advanced the OTHER's
# server-side position. Polling one card by id is idempotent and shares
# nothing with any other ask: any number of concurrent Salt Ask Human
# calls, for this agent or any other, can each resolve their own ask
# independently.
