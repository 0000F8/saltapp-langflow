"""Salt Ask Human, rewritten 2026-09-26 to poll its own card
(`GET /api/v1/cards/:id`) instead of the shared socket-mode outbox
(`GET /api/v1/agent/updates`) -- see `_salt_common.get_card`'s docstring
and HANDOFF.md's 2026-09-26 entry for why. `test_shared_cursor.py`, which
used to document the bug class this file now proves is gone, has been
deleted; the assertion that this component makes zero
`get_agent_updates` calls (in every test below, via
`_no_get_agent_updates_calls`) is what replaces it.
